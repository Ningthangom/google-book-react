                    "Known for its luxurious accommodations and bespoke service, the Hotel Louis XVI has been the most lauded boutique hotel in all of Paris for decades, attracting an international clientele of the rich and famous. Ater four years of renovations and the death of its legendary and beloved manager, it is set to reopen its doors at last. The Louis XVI's new manager, Olivier Bateau, and his level-headed assistant manager, Yvonne Philippe, both strive to continue the hotel's tradition of excellence. But they quickly realize that anything can happen at any moment-- and on one cool September evening, everything does. Clients old and new will find love, experience medical emergencies, and face threats to their lives and legacy-- among other complications. -- adapted from jacket",

She is shocked and powerless when French gendarmes take away her closest friend, Rebekah Feldmann, and her family, and send them to a detention camp for deportation to an unknown, ominous fate. The local German military commandant makes Gaelle's family estate outside Lyon into his headquarters. Her father and brother are killed by the Germans; her mother fades away into madness and ill health. Trusted friends and employees become traitors. And by accident, Gaelle begins a perilous journey with the French Resistance, hoping to save lives to make up for the beloved friend she could do nothing to help.",

                    "\"Paige Watts is the ultimate stage mother. The daughter of Hollywood royalty, Paige channels her own acting dreams into making her daughter, Emma, a star. By the age of nine, Emma is playing a central role in a hit TV show. Then everything is shattered by unforeseeable tragedy. Now Emma is living with her aunt Whitney, who had chosen a very different path than her sister. Whitney was always the studious older sister, hating the cult of celebrity that enveloped their childhood. Instead, she is a psychiatrist who lives for her work and enjoys a no-strings-attached love affair with a wealthy venture capitalist. But at a moment's notice, Whitney drops everything to help her niece. Once famous, outgoing, and charismatic, Emma is a shadow of her former self--without speech, without memory, lost and terrified. But with her aunt Whitney's help, along with a team of caregivers and doctors, Emma begins to find her way, starting her young life all over again--and changing the lives of everyone around her\"--",

The first half of the book focuses on her past, having three daughters with three different men and following her through each of those relationships. Her first love was a reclusive American living in France, much older than her, who was always a part of their daughter's life, though they never married. Her second husband went to prison for fraud when Isabelle was pregnant with her second daughter. And her third husband, her true love, drowned tragically a few months after their wedding. When the narrative switches back to present-day, Isabelle learns that she's losing her sight and hires an assistant. She bonds with each of her daughters, one in India, one in New York, and one in Tuscany, and falls in love with her assistant, Jack. She also reconnects with the son she gave up for adoption when she was 15 and her family grows stronger than ever.",
